## **GENERAL**

'Northitt' is a portfolio piece, made to demonstrate my ability to create a Full-Stack application. Using JavaScript and Node.js on a PSQL back-end. Utilising React, paired with Vite for the front-end. Hosted on Netlify.

My goal was to emulate the core functionality of a popular forum-site like Reddit, hence the name. The basic functions of this site allow users to post, comment and like articles, to and from the news feed.
